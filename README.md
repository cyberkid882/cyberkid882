### üëã Hi, I'm Ibrahim Idris
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-idris-b5712a371/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>



I'm a passionate and self-driven cybersecurity specialist from Nigeria, currently in my final year of high school. I began my cybersecurity journey at 13 and have since gained strong experience in penetration testing, digital forensics, and security operations.

I've worked closely with development teams to ensure **security is implemented from the very beginning** of the software development lifecycle. I also have hands-on experience with **SIEM platforms like Splunk and the ELK Stack**, and use **Sysmon** to enhance endpoint detection and threat visibility.

üèÜ I hold a Cisco Cybersecurity Essentials certificate, discovered a valid (but duplicate) critical bug on TikTok‚Äôs web server, and actively build my skills on platforms like TryHackMe and LetsDefend.

üîê I'm the **Head of Security** and **Co-Founder (CFO)** at [Zuhsyn Innovations Limited](#), where we focus on delivering cybersecurity solutions, SaaS platforms, AI-driven tools, and other modern technologies.

üöÄ Always learning. Always building. Always defending.



### üéØ Objective

To leverage my passion for cybersecurity and hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and secure development practices to contribute to innovative security projects. As a young and fast-growing specialist, my goal is to continuously build real-world defensive capabilities, collaborate with teams to implement security from the ground up, and drive impact through education, research, and ethical hacking‚Äîwhile advancing my career in Security Operations and Threat Intelligence.
